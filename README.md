# DA_PoC
This library is a "Proof of concept" for Data Assimilation. It implements various helper function, in order to test, and develop methods.
It is organized in different submodules
 - **variational**

    Variational methods for Data Assimilation (3D, 4DVar), focus on incremental4DVar, with conjugate gradient inversion for the inner loop

 - **filters**

    Common methods for Data Assimilation

 - **dynamical systems**

    Interface numerical models with DA methods

 - **common**
 - 
    linear algebra tools, and other utilities
